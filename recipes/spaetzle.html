    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaetzle are a well known, traditional dish you will find all over Swabia in the south west of Germany. 
        It's some sort of pasta made from a dough that funnily is a non-Newtonian fluid!
        Spaetzle can come in many different shapes, but the most well known one is the elongated
        form you can see in the image above.
        Due to the rough sourface they hold on to sauce and gravy.
        However, the most traditional dish is Spaetzle with lentils and vienna sausage - 
        in Swabian: "Linsa mit Spaetzle und Saiten"

        Make sure you carry a towl with you!

        <li>Fill your largest pot with water and bring it to a boil.</li>

                <li>A butter knife or scraper</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        <li>As soon as the water is boiling put a dollop of dough onto the board, spread the dough towards the front and start scraping off little rolls of dough into the boiling water.</li>
        <li>When you have scrapte the dough into the water wait till all spaetzle have risen to the top.</li>
        <li>Use the slotted spoon to move the spaetzle into the waiting bowl and cover them.</li>
        <li>Continue untill no dough is left.</li>
